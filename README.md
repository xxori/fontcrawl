# fontcrawl
Web scraper to find most used fonts in a given list of websites

So far, all it does is give you a bunch of `.css` files in the `res/` directory for each website, further processing to isolate `font-family` and generate visuals will be added later

## Usage
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
